(Ongoing) How does cognitive and interpersonal skills grow when on-the-job learning is heterogeneous?


Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020) find that in the presence of skill mismatch, cognitive skills adjust slowly and interpersonal skills do not adjust at all. However, they stimulate the learning process by assuming on-the-job learning along these dimension happens exponentially.

LinkedIn has text descriptions of tasks performed at each job and this text can be converted to skills to find more precise measures of learning. So, this paper aims to see if Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020)â€™s results still hold in the presence of heterogeneous learning within the same occupation.
